# 🚀 AtliQ Hardwares – SQL Ad-Hoc Business Insights Challenge

## 📌 Project Summary
AtliQ Hardwares is a leading computer hardware manufacturer in India with a strong international footprint. As the business scaled rapidly, leadership identified a challenge — lack of fast data-driven insights for strategic decision-making.

To strengthen their analytics capability, the Data Analytics Director designed a real-world SQL Ad-Hoc Challenge to assess candidates on technical SQL expertise, business problem-solving ability, and communication skills.

This repository contains my end-to-end solution to that challenge.

## 🎯 Objective
- Answer 10 real business ad-hoc requests using SQL
- Transform raw transactional data into executive-level insights
- Demonstrate advanced SQL techniques used in industry
- Present insights in a way that supports strategic decisions

## 🧠 SQL & Analytics Skills Demonstrated
- SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY
- Complex JOINS (INNER, LEFT, CROSS)
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Subqueries
- Window Functions: RANK, DENSE_RANK, OVER (PARTITION BY)
- Stored Procedures
- CREATE TABLE & UPDATE TABLE
- Aggregation, ranking, filtering, and trend analysis

## 📊 Business Problem Understanding
Top management frequently asks unplanned analytical questions such as:
- Which customers or products drive the highest revenue?
- Which markets are underperforming?
- How does performance vary across time and regions?

Each request was handled by understanding business intent, translating it into SQL logic, validating results, and converting outputs into management-ready insights.

## 🔍 Query Explanation Approach
Queries were structured using CTEs for readability, window functions for ranking and comparison, and subqueries for layered filtering. The focus was always on clarity, scalability, and business relevance.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- MySQL
- SQL Workbench
- Git & GitHub

## 🚀 Why This Project Stands Out
This project demonstrates my ability to think like a business analyst, query like a data professional, and communicate insights effectively.
